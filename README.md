# CPP_Virtual_Function
A virtual function is a member function within the base class that we redefine in a derived class.
It is also known as Runtime Polymorphism.
It is declared using the virtual keyword.
When a class containing virtual function is inherited, the derived class redefines the virtual function to suit its own words.
